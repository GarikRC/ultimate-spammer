# Ultimate-Spammer
A spammer written in Python 2.7 for Whatsapp, Skype, Facebook and Email. It has an easy to use terminal GUI and a feature to get the ip of your skype friends. It can also delete the complete skype history for preventing an overload of messages.
Also there is an update function you can call to get updates directly from github!

# Required Modules
skype4py,
selenium,
requests,
pyautogui

# Required Programms
Skype,
Firefox

# Pyautogui dependencies
Windows has no dependencies. The Win32 extensions do not need to be installed.

OS X needs the pyobjc-core and pyobjc python module installed (in that order).

Linux needs the python-Xlib module installed.

# Note
The spam attack "skype upload text" does work only on online targets. 

The same thing applies on harvesting the Ip of a skype friend.

The automated typing attack works on everyone ^^.
