# Ultimate-Spammer
A spammer written in Python 2.7 for Whatsapp, Skype, Facebook and Email. It has an easy to use Terminal Gui and a feature to get the Ip of your Skype friends. It can also delete the complete skype history for preventing an overload of messages.

# Required Modules
skype4py,
selenium,
requests,
pyautogui

# Required Programms
Skype,
Firefox

# Pyautogui dependencies

Windows has no dependencies. The Win32 extensions do not need to be installed.

OS X needs the pyobjc-core and pyobjc module installed (in that order).

Linux needs the python3-Xlib (or python-Xlib for Python 2) module installed.

# Note
The spam attack "skype upload text" does work only on online targets. 

The same thing applies on harvesting the Ip of a skype friend.

The automated typing attack works on everyone ^^.
